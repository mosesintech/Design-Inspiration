# Design Inspiration

Too often I've sat down to begin a new design project only to realize that I've forgotten everything I've ever known and I have no idea where to begin.

Not anymore.

Introducing...

The Design Inspiration Repo!!

**super hero music**

What follows is a list of websites that I enjoy looking at or that impliment something really well that I would like to... borrow from.

Under each entry is a link to another markdown file with my thoughts on their website. This file will exist in it's own directory here in the repo that will include screenshots of their website components for later reference, just in case the site goes down.
